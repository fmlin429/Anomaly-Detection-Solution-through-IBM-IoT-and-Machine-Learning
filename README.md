# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) Application Case Study through MNIST Dataset
### 1. The Objective and Ideas:

To explore more advanced areas in deep learning after the course works, I selected Generative Adversarial Networks and it’s variants, which are becoming the most important algorithm pattern in Deep Learning. MNIST Dataset’s simplicity on implementation makes it the great fit for learning the GAN concept.
